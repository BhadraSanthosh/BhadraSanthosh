- 👋 Hi, I’m Bhadra
- 👀 I’m interested in diving deep into the world of data! I'm fascinated by the power of Statistics to uncover hidden patterns and use Python and Machine Learning to turn data into insights.
- 🌱 I'm currently cultivating my skills as a B.Sc. Data Science student, I'm building a strong foundation in everything from data wrangling to model deployment.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects related to data visualization, predictive modeling, or anything that solves real-world problems with data.
